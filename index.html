                <p class="details">A claim is the right that a person has against a debtor. We then speak of a debt which the debtor must pay, by paying a sum of money which corresponds to the provision of a service or the purchase of equipment previously made. When a debt is unpaid, it is then necessary to resort to collection.</p>

                <p class="heading">Business Law</p>
                <p class="details">Business law is a section of code that is involved in protecting liberties and rights, maintaining orders, resolving disputes, and establishing standards for the business concerns and their dealings with government agencies and individuals. Every state defines its own set of regulations and laws for business organizations. Similarly, it is also the responsibility of the business concerns to know the existing rules and regulations applicable to them.</p>

                <p class="heading">Litigation and Appeal</p>
                <p class="details">Litigation is the act of bringing a case to court to settle a dispute. The term describes the actual legal process where parties argue their case against each other in our court system. Parties in a case involved are called litigants. Each party assembles its argument supported by findings and facts. Litigants, usually called plaintiff and defendant, utilize the discovery process and other court procedures to build their case before trying it in front of a judge or jury.</p>
